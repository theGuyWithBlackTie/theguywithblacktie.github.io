With the rise of LLMs, lots of data scientists are spending ton of their time on prompt engineering to test different LLMs performances on their projects. Every week a new foundational model is released which is better and cheaper than all the previous releases, tempting all of the data scientists to test one more LLM for their projects. A satisfactory LLM testing requires ample time spent on prompt engineering to cover all the edge cases successfully, and to understand all the nuances a new LLM has. This takes weeks to be done.

In the age of AI (or automation), how about a tool that can automate the prompt engineering for data scientist while saving their time to focus on actual data science work i.e. isights generation from statistics, developing AI model architectures. That's where DSPy comes in; it offers prompt tuning for different LLMs, tuning LLM weights and AI agents.
